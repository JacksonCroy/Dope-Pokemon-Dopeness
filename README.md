## Description:
​
#### This application generates two Pokemon to battle.  This application uses HTML, CSS, Jquery, and Express Handlebars on the front end and uses Node.js, Express, MySQL, and Sequelize on the back end to accomplish this.  This site is hosted using Heroku, which you can find linked below.
​
## Usage: 
​
#### -When the user goes to the application, a splash page gives them the option to choose two Pokemon to fight, go to the Pokedex, or create their own custom Pokemon.
​
#### -If the user navigates to the "Choose" page, they can choose two separate Pokemon to fight.  There are two input boxes- one for the player's Pokemon, and one for the opposing Pokemon.  The user needs to input the official number of the Pokemon for the corresponding Pokemon to be selected.  Then a program runs to calculate the attack power and hit points to see which Pokemon will be victorious.
​
#### -The Pokedex page is where the user can view all the Pokemon and their stats, as well as the official number of the Pokemon which needs to be input to select the specific Pokemon.
​
#### -The "Create" page is where a user can create their own custom Pokemon with all the necessary stats. Once the custom Pokemon is added, it is added into the MySQL database and can then be used to do battle.
